# BrewFinder
Mobile Dev 2 Final Project

This is the final project for my Mobile Dev 2 Class.

I call this app BrewFinder!

It's a simple app that pulls from the Open Brewery DB API. It is a curated list of "craft" breweries.

The app is set so that the user can search their nearest city, and it will pull the nearest "craft" breweries. 

Once clicking into the brewery, there is the Apple Maps integration which shows where on the map the brewery is located.

The page also includes the brewery address, and the brewery website.

For future updates, I'd like to add the ability for the user to save the breweries, and save a list of the beers they try!

Unfortunately, at the time of submission, the API was experiencing issues which prevented me from fully developing.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project!
